##### CLI Tool

A robust tool that features a wide array of bots and monitors, specifically designed for various e-commerce websites. Powered by a flexible framework, it facilitates the effortless creation of new site integrations, complete with essential features like task creation, site-specific configurations, and common modules. Although no longer actively maintained, this tool remains a testament to my dedication to innovation and problem-solving within Software Engineering.

##### Site & Chrome Extension Companion

A powerful web application designed to complement the CLI tool. This full-fledged web app, built with **React** and an **Express** backend, offers secure authentication and role-based access control. Users can upload cart sessions captured through the CLI tool and can then confidently buy and sell these cart sessions to other users, creating a dynamic marketplace. The web app includes a secure payment system powered by Stripe, enabling users to conveniently purchase tokens that grant access to cart sessions. Additionally, a Chrome extension companion allows buyers to effortlessly load purchased sessions directly into their browsers.
